## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned
email submission

```js
{
  const email = document.getElementById('email').value;  
}
```

### Continued development
I want to focus more on javascript and its library (marjorly react) moving foward in my web development journey.

### Useful resources

- [Web 3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) - This helped me for success message and error message. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
